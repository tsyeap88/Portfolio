# Final Project: 

## Investigating the Case of Jack the Ripper with Data Mining

## Team: Audrey Crockett, TS Yeap

#### Can we identify who is Jack the Ripper using data mining?

This project is done in R. We used tidyverse package to transform the letters collected from the Internet to a CSV file. 
Then we explored the dataset using WordCloud. Lastly, we used K-means, desicion tree and SVM to cluster/classify the suspects at the time
to identify who is the actual Jack the Ripper. 

## Descriptions of the files:
presentation: the files needed in flexdashboard presentation
R_code: The rmd files for wordcloud, Kmeans, desicion tree and SVM
text_document: The original text files of Jack the Ripper and the 6 suspects
dataset: the final data frame from the original text files

Software required: R studio
