# Final Project: Investigating the Case of Jack the Ripper with Data Mining

#### Can we identify who is Jack the Ripper using data mining?

This project is done in R. We used tidyverse package to transform the letters collected from the Internet to a CSV file. 
Then we explored the dataset using WordCloud. Lastly, we used K-means, desicion tree and SVM to cluster/classify the suspects at the time
to identify who is the actual Jack the Ripper.
