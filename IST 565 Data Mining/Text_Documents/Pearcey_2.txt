Dearest Frank,  I cannot sleep, so am going to write you a long letter. When you read this I hope your head will be much better, dear. I can’t bear to see you like you were this evening. Try not to give way. Try to be brave, dear, for things will come right in the end. I know things look dark now, but it is always the darkest hour before the dawn. You said this evening, “I don’t know what I ask.” But I do know. Why should you want to take your life because you want to have everything your own way? So you think you will take that which no man has a right? Never take that which you cannot give you will not if you love me as you say you do. Oh, Frank, I should not like to think I was the cause of all your troubles, and yet you make me think so. What can I do? I love you with all my heart, and I will love her because she will belong to you. Yes, I will come and see you both if you wish it. So, dear, try and be strong, as strong as me, for a man should be stronger than a woman. Shall I see you on Wednesday about two o’clock? Try and get away, too, on Friday, as I want to know if you are off on Sunday till seven o’clock. Write me a little note in answer to this. I shall be down on Monday or Tuesday in the morning, about 5 a.m. So believe me your most loving, M.E.
