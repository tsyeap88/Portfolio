Dear Roche

just a line to let you know how I am. I have felt very well all the time I have been away from Aldershot and have had no inconveniences at all. I have taken those capsules regularly, four a day. There is still a slight sign of glete, but so slight, that it is hardly percep and only when I get up of a morning. I have been careful about my diet and taken only a limited quantity of wine. So if you wish, you can come and see me about 11.30, as I shall have arrived by then.
