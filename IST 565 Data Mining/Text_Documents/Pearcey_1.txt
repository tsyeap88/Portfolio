My dear F,  Do not think of going away, for my heart will break if you do; don’t go , dear. I won’t talk too much, only to see you for five minutes when you can get away; but if you go quite away, how do you think I can live? I would see you married fifty times over, yes. I could bear that far better than parting with you for ever, and that is what it would be if you went out of England. My dear loving F, you was so down-hearted to-day that your words give me much pain for I have only one true friend I can trust to, and that is yourself. Don’t take that from me. What good would your friendship be then with you so far away? No, no, you must not go away. My heart throbs with pain only thinking about it. What would it be if you went? I should die. And if you love me as you say you do, you will stay. Write or come soon, dear. Have I asked too much?  From your loving, M. E.

P.S.  I hope you got home safe, and things are all right, and you are well.  M.E.
